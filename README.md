## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/mGd5VpbO4JnzU6I9l96x) was to build an application to complete the given user stories:

- ✅ User story: When I select the items tab, I can see a list of items under different categories.

- ✅ User story: I can add a new item with name, category, note, and image.

- ✅ User story: When I add a new item, I can select one from the existing categories or add a new one if the category does not exist

- ✅ User story: When I select an item, I can see its details and I can choose to add the current list or delete the item.

- ✅ User story: I can add items to the current list

- ✅ User story: I can increase the number of item in the list

- ✅ User story: I can remove the item from the list

- ✅ User story: I can save/update the list with a name (user can have only one active list at a time)

- ✅ User story: I can toggle between editing state and completing state

- ✅ User story: When I am at completing state, I can save my progress by selecting the item

- ✅ User story: I can cancel the active list

- ✅ User story: When I try to cancel a list, I can see a confirmation notification

- User story: I can see my shopping history and I can see the details of it

- User story: I can see some statistics: top items, top categories, and monthly comparison. (Tips: use libraries like recharts for the graph)

- User story (optional): I can search for items
